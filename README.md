# MRI_segmentation

This program was created as an assignment for an online course. A neural network is built to 
automatically segment tumor regions in the brain using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
scans. 

First the data itself is exlored, then preprocessed including normalization. A model with a
3D U-Net structure is built. The model is trained on BraTS data in the NifTI-1 format and 
finally evaluated.
